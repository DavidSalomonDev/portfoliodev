				<Paragraph>I have worked as a Technical Support Representative for one of the largest internet brands since

					In 2020, I took advantage of the lock-down, and I reinforced my coding skills with Javascript and React.

					As of right now, I'm an Applications Support Analyst, helping customers to use Google APIs for their services,
